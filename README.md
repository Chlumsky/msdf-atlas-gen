# Multi-channel signed distance field atlas generator

This is a utility for generating compact font atlases using [MSDFgen](https://github.com/Chlumsky/msdfgen).

The atlas generator loads a subset of glyphs from a TTF or OTF font file, generates a distance field for each of them, and tightly packs them into an atlas bitmap (example below). The finished atlas and/or its layout metadata can be exported as an [Artery Font](https://github.com/Chlumsky/artery-font-format) file, a plain image file, a CSV sheet or a structured JSON file.

![Atlas example](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/18639794/76163889-811f2e80-614a-11ea-9b28-1eed54dbb899.png)

A font atlas is typically stored in texture memory and used to draw text in real-time rendering contexts such as video games.

## Atlas types

The atlas generator can generate the following six types of atlases.

| |Hard mask|Soft mask|SDF|PSDF|MSDF|MTSDF|
|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|
| |![Hard mask](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/18639794/76163903-9eec9380-614a-11ea-92cb-d49485bbad31.png)|![Soft mask](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/18639794/76163904-a1e78400-614a-11ea-912a-b220fed081cb.png)|![SDF](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/18639794/76163905-a4e27480-614a-11ea-93eb-c80819a44e6e.png)|![PSDF](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/18639794/76163907-a6ac3800-614a-11ea-8d97-dafc1db6711d.png)|![MSDF](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/18639794/76163909-a9a72880-614a-11ea-9726-e825ee0dde94.png)|![MTSDF](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/18639794/76163910-ac098280-614a-11ea-8b6b-811d864cd584.png)|
|Channels:|1 (1-bit)|1|1|1|3|4|
|Anti-aliasing:|-|Yes|Yes|Yes|Yes|Yes|
|Scalability:|-|-|Yes|Yes|Yes|Yes|
|Sharp corners:|-|-|-|-|Yes|Yes|
|Soft effects:|-|-|Yes|-|-|Yes|
|Hard effects:|-|-|-|Yes|Yes|Yes|

Notes:
- *Sharp corners* refers to preservation of corner sharpness when upscaled.
- *Soft effects* refers to the support of effects that use true distance, such as glows, rounded borders, or simplified shadows.
- *Hard effects* refers to the support of effects that use pseudo-distance, such as mitered borders or thickness adjustment.

## Getting started

This project can be used either as a library or as a standalone console program.
To start using the program immediately, there is a Windows binary available for download in the ["Releases" section](https://github.com/Chlumsky/msdf-atlas-gen/releases).
To build the project, you may use the included [Visual Studio solution](msdf-atlas-gen.sln) or the [Unix Makefile](Makefile).

## Command line arguments

Use the following command line arguments for the standalone version of the atlas generator.

### Input

- `-font <fontfile.ttf/otf>` (required) &ndash; sets the input font file.
- `-charset <charset.txt>` &ndash; sets the character set. The ASCII charset will be used if not specified. See [the syntax specification](#character-set-specification-syntax) of `charset.txt`.
- `-glyphset <glyphset.txt>` &ndash; sets the set of input glyphs using their indices within the font file. See [the syntax specification](#glyph-set-specification).
- `-fontscale <scale>` &ndash; applies a scaling transformation to the font's glyphs. Mainly to be used to generate multiple sizes in a single atlas, otherwise use [`-size`](#glyph-configuration).
- `-fontname <name>` &ndash; sets a name for the font that will be stored in certain output files as metadata.
- `-and` &ndash; separates multiple inputs to be combined into a single atlas.

### Bitmap atlas type

`-type <type>` &ndash; see [Atlas types](#atlas-types)

`<type>` can be one of:

- `hardmask` &ndash; a non-anti-aliased binary image
- `softmask` &ndash; an anti-aliased image
- `sdf` &ndash; a true signed distance field (SDF)
- `psdf` &ndash; a pseudo-distance field
- `msdf` (default) &ndash; a multi-channel signed distance field (MSDF)
- `mtsdf` &ndash; a combination of MSDF and true SDF in the alpha channel

### Atlas image format

`-format <format>`

`<format>` can be one of:

- `png` &ndash; a compressed PNG image
- `bmp` &ndash; an uncompressed BMP image
- `tiff` &ndash; an uncompressed floating-point TIFF image
- `text` &ndash; a sequence of pixel values in plain text
- `textfloat` &ndash; a sequence of floating-point pixel values in plain text
- `bin` &ndash; a sequence of pixel values encoded as raw bytes of data
- `binfloat` &ndash; a sequence of pixel values encoded as raw 32-bit floating-point values

### Atlas dimensions

`-dimensions <width> <height>` &ndash; sets fixed atlas dimensions

Alternativelly, the minimum possible dimensions may be selected automatically if a dimensions constraint is set instead:

- `-pots` &ndash; a power-of-two square
- `-potr` &ndash; a power-of-two square or rectangle (2:1)
- `-square` &ndash; any square dimensions
- `-square2` &ndash; square with even side length
- `-square4` (default) &ndash; square with side length divisible by four

### Outputs

Any non-empty subset of the following may be specified:

- `-imageout <filename.*>` &ndash; saves the atlas bitmap as a plain image file. Format matches `-format`
- `-json <filename.json>` &ndash; writes the atlas's layout data as well as other metrics into a structured JSON file
- `-csv <filename.csv>` &ndash; writes the glyph layout data into a simple CSV file
- `-arfont <filename.arfont>` &ndash; saves the atlas and its layout data as an [Artery Font](https://github.com/Chlumsky/artery-font-format) file
- `-shadronpreview <filename.shadron> <sample text>` &ndash; generates a [Shadron script](https://www.arteryengine.com/shadron/) that uses the generated atlas to draw a sample text as a preview

### Glyph configuration

- `-size <EM size>` &ndash; sets the size of the glyphs in the atlas in pixels per EM
- `-minsize <EM size>` &ndash; sets the minimum size. The largest possible size that fits the same atlas dimensions will be used
- `-emrange <EM range>` &ndash; sets the distance field range in EM's
- `-pxrange <pixel range>` (default = 2) &ndash; sets the distance field range in output pixels

### Distance field generator settings

- `-angle <angle>` &ndash; sets the minimum angle between adjacent edges to be considered a corner. Append D for degrees (`msdf` / `mtsdf` only)
- `-errorcorrection <threshold>` &ndash; sets the threshold used to detect and correct potential artifacts. 0 disables error correction (`msdf` / `mtsdf` only)
- `-miterlimit <value>` &ndash; sets the miter limit that limits the extension of each glyph's bounding box due to very sharp corners (`psdf` / `msdf` / `mtsdf` only)
- `-overlap` &ndash; switches to distance field generator with support for overlapping contours
- `-nopreprocess` &ndash; disables path preprocessing which resolves self-intersections and overlapping contours
- `-scanline` &ndash; performs an additional scanline pass to fix the signs of the distances
- `-seed <N>` &ndash; sets the initial seed for the edge coloring heuristic
- `-threads <N>` &ndash; sets the number of threads for the parallel computation (0 = auto)

## Character set specification syntax

The character set file is a text file with UTF-8 or ASCII encoding.
The characters can be denoted in the following ways:

- Single character: `'A'` (UTF-8 encoded), `65` (decimal Unicode), `0x41` (hexadecimal Unicode)
- Range of characters: `['A', 'Z']`, `[65, 90]`, `[0x41, 0x5a]`
- String of characters: `"ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ"` (UTF-8 encoded)

The entries should be separated by commas or whitespace.
In between quotation marks, backslash is used as the escape character (e.g. `'\''`, `'\\'`, `"!\"#"`).
The order in which characters appear is not taken into consideration.

Additionally, the include directive can be used to include other charset files and combine character sets in a hierarchical way.
It must be written on a separate line:

`@include "base-charset.txt"`

### Glyph set specification

The syntax of the glyph set specification is mostly the same as that of a character set, but only numeric values (decimal and hexadecimal) are allowed.
